  Develop foundational skills in R and Bioconductor, including data handling, visualisation, and reproducible research practices tailored for genomic data analysis.

- **March 26-27:** RNA-seq Data Analysis and Interpretation  
  Dive into RNA-seq workflows, from preprocessing to differential expression analysis, and gain practical experience with real-world datasets.

- **March 28:** Bring Your Own Data (BYO) Day  
  Apply your skills to your own data or explore additional datasets, with personalised guidance and collaborative support from instructors.

## üéì Instructors

The workshop will be led by a team of Carpentries-certified instructors from the Bioconductor community, including both local bioinformatics experts and experienced international instructors. This blend ensures a diversity of perspectives and expertise, fostering a strong collaborative learning environment.

## Registration

A single registration covers the full week of sessions. Registration details, including the application form, will be posted soon. We welcome participants who are keen to develop their bioinformatics skills with a focus on genomic data analysis.

## Funding and Support
